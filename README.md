Six degrees of separation

According to wikipeidia, six degrees of separation is the idea that all people are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. As a result, a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation).

In this project, a social network graph is built among the New York social elite using photos posted on New York Social Diary (https://web.archive.org/web/20150913224145/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/), a website posts local ocial events and photos of those people who attended the events. 

From this network graph, I use the connections among the social elite to explore questions such as who is the most popular people, who is the most influential people and who are the most closely connected couples. Most important, I want to test the six degrees of separation theory about social connections.
